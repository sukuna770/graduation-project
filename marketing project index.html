            <h2>Corporate History & Evolution</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1987 by Dietrich Mateschitz and Chaleo Yoovidhya, Red Bull transformed from a Thai tonic drink (Krating Daeng) into a global phenomenon. The company's innovative marketing strategies helped it capture a significant share of the global energy drink market.</p>
            <p>Red Bull's journey began when Mateschitz, an Austrian entrepreneur, discovered Krating Daeng during a business trip to Thailand. Recognizing its potential, he partnered with Yoovidhya to adapt the drink for Western markets. The formula was modified to be less sweet and carbonated, catering to European tastes.</p>
            <p>In 1987, Red Bull GmbH was established in Austria, and the drink was launched with the slogan "Red Bull gives you wings." The brand's early success was driven by its unique positioning as a premium energy drink, targeting young professionals, students, and athletes.</p>
            <p>By the mid-1990s, Red Bull expanded into other European markets, including Hungary, Germany, and the UK. Its entry into the United States in 1997 marked a turning point, as the brand adopted aggressive marketing tactics to establish itself in a competitive market.</p>
            <p>Red Bull's growth has been fueled by its ability to create a lifestyle brand. The company doesn't just sell energy drinks; it sells an image of vitality, adventure, and extreme sports. This approach has made Red Bull one of the most recognizable brands globally.</p>
            <p>Today, Red Bull operates in over 170 countries and sells billions of cans annually. The company has diversified its portfolio, introducing sugar-free and flavored variants to cater to changing consumer preferences.</p>
            <p>Key milestones in Red Bull's history include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1987: Launch of Red Bull in Austria.</li>
                <li>1992: Expansion into Hungary, the first international market.</li>
                <li>1997: Entry into the United States.</li>
                <li>2004: Introduction of Red Bull Sugarfree.</li>
                <li>2012: Red Bull Stratos, Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking space jump.</li>
